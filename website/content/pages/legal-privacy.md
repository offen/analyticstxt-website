# Legal & Privacy

## Website Analytics
We use [Offen](https://offen.analyticstxt.org/) for collecting usage data on this website and only access your usage data with your consent. Your data always remains yours. You can review and delete it at any time. Opt out again whenever you want.

### How can I review and delete my usage data?
For data to be collected you need to opt in first. [You can do this in the consent banner.](https://offen.analyticstxt.org/#consent-banner)

### What data is collected?
Only page views, sessions, referrer and visited URLs are collected. From this, other metrics such as the bounce rate are calculated.

### What data isn't collected?
Location data, device information and engagement are not collected. There are also no fingerprinting technologies in use.

### How is my data handled?
Your usage data is encrypted end-to-end. It will be automatically deleted after 6 months. You can delete your usage data yourself at any time.

### Why do I need to opt in or opt out?
Our banner serves two purposes: We ask you to access your usage data and would like to obtain your consent for its use.

### Do you use cookies?
Yes, in particular cookies are used to store your decision about granting access to your usage data. If you opt in, we also use cookies to store a user and a session ID for you.

### How does it all work?
After opening a website where an Offen installation is active, you can explicitly opt in to the data collection and thereby help to improve the services you use. Only then you will be assigned a user and a session ID using a cookie. Offen handles these IDs in an unrecognizable form. [Learn more about cookies here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie){: target="_blank"}
